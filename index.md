# the evolution of the web thru my eye as a web developer

This page is a brief of the [evolution of the web](http://www.evolutionoftheweb.com) programing over the last two decade.

I've started to look for my next framework, environment, language... for web application development.
after meny years using Visual Studio coding c#, asp.net for iis / sql server on windows machines, i'm looking for an open-source solution, node.js based, that supports most [PWA](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) features.

Reading [this article](https://medium.com/@harryho2/angular-vs-react-vs-vue-f470f5b74bf6) and meny more 'VS' articles i've choose vue.js as my next front end technology.
